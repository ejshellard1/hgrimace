                Ecstatic elegance, gay disposition. we made rent, offering up our bad educations. hung up equally. taking comfort in manners. we oppose the desires thrown at us. reserved, indulgence, hard to read. excuse me please? self-assured. touched my tits. badly-bred landlords discover sincerity. curiosity. quiet decay. build walls of china around moonlit men, whose sweetness is lead. it tears their balls to shreds. less than nervous. spare me the lip service. terminate it. take some of these & read the news. we got excellent reviews. delays, fancy noise. invited to hang out with the boys. projective arseholes. she was graceful, shy & believed in distance.  synthesizers used to get that much resistance. now theyre all the rage. these days, its prescribed sex. enjoyment. new age behaviour. fucking great entertainment.
